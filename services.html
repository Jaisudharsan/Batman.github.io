            <h2>Evolution of Batman</h2>
            <p>As Batman, my journey through the decades is a testament to both my enduring relevance and the ever-changing landscape of popular culture. Since my creation in 1939, I have evolved from a brooding vigilante into one of the most complex and multifaceted characters in fiction. 
                My story reflects not only the shifts in societal values and storytelling trends but also the advancements in technology and artistic styles.</p>

                <li class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>1930s - The Dark Knight Emerges</h3>
                    <p>I first emerged in Detective Comics #27, crafted by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. I was introduced as a dark, brooding vigilante, driven by a tragic past and determined to fight crime in Gotham City. 
                        My mission was to instill fear in the hearts of criminals and seek justice for those who couldn't defend themselves.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after, I took on my first sidekick, Robin (Dick Grayson), in Detective Comics #38. His presence brought a new dynamic to our fight against crime and introduced a lighter, more hopeful element to our adventures.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>1940s - The Golden Age</h3>
                    <p>My origin story and supporting characters started to take shape. Commissioner Gordon and the Batmobile became key elements in my crime-fighting arsenal.
                        I faced my first major adversary, the Joker, in Batman #1. This marked the beginning of a long and complex relationship with one of my most iconic foes.</p>   
                    <p>I appeared in serial films, with Lewis Wilson and Robert Lowery portraying me. These early live-action representations began to shape how the world saw me.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>1960s - The Campy Batman</h3>
                    <p>My transformation began with the debut of the "Batman" TV series, starring Adam West as me and Burt Ward as Robin. This series was a radical departure from my darker origins. 
                        Embracing a campy, humorous tone, the show was known for its bright, colorful visuals, over-the-top villains, and playful dialogue.</p>
                    <p>The villains I faced, including the Joker (played by Cesar Romero), the Penguin (Burgess Meredith), and Catwoman (Julie Newmar), were portrayed with a mix of flamboyance and comedy. 
                        Their schemes were often absurd and theatrical, reflecting the show’s emphasis on humor and entertainment rather than serious crime-fighting.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>1980s - The Dark and Gritty Rebirth</h3>
                    <p> Frank Miller’s "The Dark Knight Returns" reinvented me as a grizzled, older hero in a dystopian future. This portrayal emphasized my complexity and moral ambiguity, significantly influencing how I would be seen in the modern era.
                        Tim Burton’s "Batman" film, starring Michael Keaton, presented me with a gothic and darkly stylized approach. This film redefined me for a new generation, blending a darker tone with Burton’s unique vision.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>2000s - The Modern Era</h3>
                    <p>Christopher Nolan’s "Batman Begins" rebooted my story, focusing on a realistic and psychologically complex portrayal. This version of me emphasized my origin, my struggle with duality, and my role as a symbol of justice.</p>
                    <p>In "The Dark Knight," I faced the Joker once again, this time portrayed by Heath Ledger. The film explored deeper moral dilemmas and showcased my ongoing struggle against chaos and anarchy.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="timeline-item">
                    <h3>2010s - A New Legacy</h3>
                    <p>"The Dark Knight Rises" concluded Nolan’s trilogy, wrapping up my journey from a troubled vigilante to a redeemed hero.
                        In "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," portrayed by Ben Affleck, I grappled with my role as a battle-worn and morally conflicted hero. This film explored the ethical challenges of my vigilantism.</p>
                    <p>"The Batman," directed by Matt Reeves and starring Robert Pattinson, offered a fresh take on me as a younger, detective-focused hero. 
                        This version emphasized my investigative skills and presented a noir-inspired look at my efforts to unravel the corruption in Gotham City.</p>
